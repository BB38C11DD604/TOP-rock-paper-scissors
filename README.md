This is my very first project. a rock paper scissors game based on https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors.

My goal is to practice getting into the habit of starting with algorithms then translating that into code. "Comments are not meant to help humans understand code. Code is meant to help computers understand comments."

This project is close to something I was already thinking of making, so I am thinking of going far beyond what The Odin Project requires.
