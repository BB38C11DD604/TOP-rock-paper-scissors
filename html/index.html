<!--
OK, this is my first iteration of this program. I got the basic functionality
down and did what was required by The Odin Project, but there are a few glaring
bugs. The biggest is that the RNG isn't working as I thought it would, on two
fronts.

First, computerPlay() uses getRandomInteger(). I thought I split it 33.3%
on all fronts, but it seems that I need to go 33.3 for the first, then 50/50. This
means that getRandomInteger() gets processed again after the first time, even when
I store that value in another variable. Either that or my math is completely off.

Second, even when I get computerPlay() to output equally, playRound() isn't working
as intended. There is something very wrong in the logic of how the win/loss is
distributed. I can think of a fix, but I want to understand WHY it isn't working.
There are more lessons and projects to move on to, so I will do that for now, but
I wish to return to this and figure out WHY these two things are behaving this way,
then proceed to issue a fix.
