This is my very first project. a rock paper scissors game based on https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors.

My goal is to practice getting into the habit of starting with algorithms then translating that into easily readable code. "Comments are not meant to help humans understand code. Code is meant to help computers understand comments." + " Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."

This project is close to something I was already thinking of making, so I am thinking of going far beyond what The Odin Project requires.
